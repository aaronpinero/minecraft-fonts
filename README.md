# Minecraft Fonts

Minecraft fonts are based on the style of text in the game Minecraft. There are two fonts:

- Minecraft Titling is based on the font of the official Minecraft logo.
- Minecraft Text is based on the font use for messages within the game.

Minecraft Text is based on the font Minecraftia by [Andrew Tyler](https://andrewtyler.gumroad.com). This font needed to be rebuild because the font's baseline was badly set.

These fonts were generated using the svgtofont NPM package and are intended only for web use. There are a limited number of glyphs available; this does not completely cover the Latin character set.
